This is a file that will have a merge conflict.

Merge conflicts occur during a merge when the same lines of files being merged have been edited by two different sources.
This usually occurs when multiple branches are being merged into a parent branch (for me this has usually occurred while merging to the master)
Sometimes this also happens during a pull if the branch you are pulling has changed since you started editing your local version of the branch.

Once you try to merge two branches that have both edited the same lines of a file, git will let you know a merge conflict has occurred.
In order to resolve these conflicts you have to pick which lines of code should remain in the newly merged branch.
Git shows you which sections have conflicts by inserting in conflict markers.

The markers look something like this:
<<<HEAD- this marker come before the edited section from the current branch.
===- this marker separates the two blocks of changed code.
>>> Name-of-branch- this marker tells you the name of the branch that you are merging into the current branch.
                    It also marks the end of that block of code.
					
All you have to do to fix the conflict is delete the markers and any unwanted code. 
This might mean taking parts from both branches or picking the code from only one branch.
Unless you know exactly which parts are necessary, it is essential to talk to the authors of the branches to work out what code should be kept.

Once you've fixed the code you then must use the add command to let the merge commit know that you think you've fixed the conflict.
Once all conflicts have been fixed, you should commit the changes and push the merged branch.
					
In this report I will be demonstrating a merge conflict caused by merging two different branches into the master.
