This is a file that will have a merge conflict.

When multiple branches edit the same lines of a file a conflict occurs. Git doesn't know which parts it should keep.

It keeps track of three things: the sections that each branch both changed, the HEAD (which is the changes in the current branch), and the changes already merged to the master (or other parent branch)
