This is a file that will have a merge conflict.

Merge conflicts occur during a merge when the same lines of files being merged have been edited by two different sources.
This usually occurs when multiple branches are being merged into a parent branch (for me this has usually occurred while merging to the master)
Sometimes this also happens during a pull if the branch you are pulling has changed since you started editing your local version of the branch.


In this report I will be demonstrating a merge conflict caused by merging two different branches into the master.
