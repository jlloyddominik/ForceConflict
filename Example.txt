This is a file that will have a merge conflict.

This second branch will cause a conflict once I merge it to the master.

When this happens git will use these strings to show where conflicts have occured.

<<<<<< HEAD

|||||| Merged common ancestors

>>>>>> master

in order to resolve the conflict all one has to do is review the sections.
Remove the incorrect sections of code (the ancestor code is unlikely to be what I want in the merge).
Work out what from the HEAD code needs to be put into the master code and add it.
Then once the section is the way we want it, we delete all the special code used to separate
the different versions of the file.
